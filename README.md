# SheetRocks Weekly Report Example

This is a simple script to demonstrate the functionality of the SheetRocks API. 

This script creates an example data set, loads the data as a CSV into SheetRocks, adds some analysis of the data, and
shares the workbook as a custom report.

This is just a simple example - in SheetRocks, anything you can do through the user interface, you can also do through the API.

### Dependencies
- NodeJS

### Running the script
```
$ npm install
$ SR_API_TOKEN={your SheetRocks API token} node main.js
```
